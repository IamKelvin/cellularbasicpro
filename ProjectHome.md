Advantages of CellularBasicPro :

CellularBasicPro is a simple yet powerful multi-purpose programming
language. Its syntax is similar to QBASIC.
Since it runs on cellular phones, it gives you the ability to program
practically everywhere : Your cell phone becomes an ultra-small computer
that goes with you wherever you go !

Cellular phones have much much more battery time and are much more lighter
than any laptop or pocket PC and do not have those noisy fans to cool their cpu... :))
Therefore this gives you lots of programming time.
Cellular phones are also excellent embedded devices. They do not have moving parts
like cooling fans or hard drives. This makes them perfect for embedded applications
such as robotics.

CellularBasicPro can be used by students, engineers and anyone that needs
portable graphing and formula programming, therefore it can also be a great
replacement for expensive programmable graphing calculators.

CellularBasicPro is also great for programming hobbysts that want to
program on the go small applications or games.

CellularBasicPro has now also the ability to create a bluetooth connection
with a LEGO mindstorms NXT brick and therefore it can control a NXT robot
and give the NXT robot the additional processing power and features of
your cellular phone !

If you enjoyed in the past programming the good old ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 or
QBASIC in DOS, you will surely enjoy programming in CellularBasicPro.
